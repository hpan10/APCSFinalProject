Group Name: 2D Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars

Group Members: Emmanuel Abayev, Harry Pan

Brief Project Description (1 paragraph summary):
This project is intended to emulate the popular vehicular soccer game, Rocket League, developed by Psyonix. 
Of course, we’re doing this on a much smaller scale than the original game, as we’re turning the 3D game 
into a 2D knockoff of it. The goal of the game is simple: use your car to hit a ball into the opposing net 
and score more goals than your opponent. We intend to make this a two-player game and develop this project 
in Processing.

Compile/Run instructions: It's in Processing, so just hit run!

During class time, worked with Harry in the breakout room on setting up our basic structure. We succeeded in fitting our 4 files with the methods and instance variables, as well as their constructors, that we outlined in our UML. Long road ahead is right!
